Recently holding a doctorate, entitled _"Audiovisual speech representation learning applied to emotion recognition"_, I am embarking on a new journey in a post-doctoral position.

My research spans multimodal (audiovisual) and generative models. I aim to develop latent spaces that encode high-level features in an interpretable manner, facilitating human understanding.
