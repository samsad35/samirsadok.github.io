I am a Ph.D. student at CentraleSupelec in Rennes, specializing in the analysis and understanding of latent representations of generative models using deep learning techniques. My research focuses on linking these latent representations with high-level variation factors, such as emotions. Currently, I am engaged in developing hierarchical models for multimodal data through the use of dynamical variational autoencoder.

My recent research has led me to explore weakly supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised methods to learn audiovisual speech representations for emotion detection. This area of study has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of emotion recognition systems, and I am excited to be at the forefront of this exciting field.
