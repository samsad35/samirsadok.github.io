I am a PhD student at CentraleSupelec, Rennes.
My research interests are the analysis and understanding of latent representations of generative
models by deep learning, with the aim of linking these latent representations with high-level
variation factors such as emotions. My current activities are hierarchical modeling for multimodal data via dynamical 
variational autoencoder.
